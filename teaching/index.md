## Teaching Philosophy
My pedagogical approach integrates Lacanian psychoanalytic theory with composition studies, emphasizing the impossibility of complete understanding as a productive space for learning. I focus on creating inclusive classrooms where students develop critical thinking skills through engagement with complex texts and ideas.
