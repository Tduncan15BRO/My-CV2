### "The Limits of Understanding: Lacanian Pedagogy in the Composition Classroom"
- **Journal**: *Journal on Excellence in College Teaching*
- **Publication Date**: May 2025
- Abstract: This article presents a challenge to notions of clarity—and its relation to understanding—within the college composition classroom by relying on Lacanian pedagogical theory. While the field of composition has issued criticisms against clarity in student writing, there has been less emphasis on interrogating clarity in instruction. By delineating Lacanian pedagogy, the article provides a theoretical and pedagogical framework for integrating Lacanian non-sense into the composition classroom. Through this integration of Lacanian non-sense through metaphor, the author argues that a procedural knowledge that exceeds conventional notions of understanding and provokes thought can emerge.

### "Recognizing Exploitation and Rejecting Analogy: An Analysis of the Meat-Commodity"
- **Journal**: *Between the Species*
- **Publication Date**: March 2024
- Abstract: This paper is a two-part project. First, I reject the analogous relationship between the Holocaust and slaughterhouses (found in the anti-meat novel The Lives of Animals) and cross-species analogical thinking entirely; instead, I opt for modes of analysis that can examine the specific circumstances of animals within slaughterhouses. Secondly, I assert that a socio-economic Marxist analysis is the best prism in which to recognize the suffering of pre-slaughter animals and the causation of their suffering (the ostensibly necessary circulation and production of the meat-commodity).

### "The Inexplicable Real and Silent (Female) Desire: A Lacanian Approach to the Unsaid in The Awakening"
- **Journal**: *Midwest Quarterly*
- **Publication Date**: January 2023
- Abstract: Every text consists of silential gaps and wordlessness; there are points in any text where words indicate the unsaid and the inexpressible rather than being utilized as tools of immediate signification. Not only does content and form (what is present within a text) divulge something about a character or the narrative world, but what is omitted, and emphasized as absent, also similarly reveal something about a character's subjectivity and the textual world they occupy. Simply, narratives always consist of omissions--and what is excluded is just as telling as what is included. Kate Chopin's 1899 novel, The Awakening, is comprised of these significant gaps of the unutterable and the unsaid--mostly in some relation to the specific silence of female desire in the late nineteenth century (that would continue on into the twentieth century). In Lacanian thought, this kind of pervasive silence exists, and is meaningful, because there is a pronounced limit of signifiers: to Lacan there is pre-lingual phenomena and internal processes that exists beyond the bounds of the symbolic (meaning signifier or language-based) inter-subjective communication.

### "Politics of Dismissal and Death: Tentacle, Necropolitics, and the Political Subject"
- **Journal**: *Latin American Literary Review*
- **Publication Date**: November 2022
- Abstract: In Rita Indiana’s novel, Tentacle, the future of the Dominic Republic is postulated as bleak and dystopian: a nuclear ecological disaster has nearly ruined the ocean, colorism and racism are pervasive, Haitians are indiscriminately executed due to an unnamed “virus”(Indiana 3), and historical class divisions, as well as wealth inequalities, are maintained. The various issues that Indiana’s future-oriented Dominican Republic is facing emerge from political contingencies: they are the result of clear choices facilitated by the political leaders of the Dominican Republic. Yet, while the text renders historical reality as contingent and liable to change, it also explicitly points out the limits of individual agency and action. Tentacle demonstrates the politico-ontological dismissal of subjects that is enacted through necropolitics. The text also recognizes the contingent nature of political formation and necropolitics, and by doing so, implicitly contests the essentialization of formerly colonized countries such as the Dominican Republic. Ultimately, I argue that the precarity of the political subject and the material-political-reality are not depicted in Tentacle as necessary or inevitable parts of some dialectic process of progression, but rather as potentially preventable or intervenable processes that evade individual agency.

### "Žižekian Ideology and the 'Sympathetic' Slave-Owner: Ostensible Necessity of Slavery in Our Nig and Minnie's Sacrifice"
- **Journal**: *International Journal of Žižek Studies*
- **Publication Date**: July 2021
- Abstract: I will look at and discuss the ideological-subject position of the ‘sympathetic’slave-owner by employing Žižek’s specific conception of ideology across two varying slave-narratives. I attempt to uncover how this ideology operates within the social-material reality in the texts Our Nig and Minnie's Sacrifice and the ways that the authors (Harper and Wilson) employed tropes in depicting this particular archetypal figure in slave-narratives. These charachter's exhibit an ideology remarkably aligned with Žižek’s: that a certain non-knowledge of the proper logic of an ideological reality is what sustains it. This suggests not only that such an archetypal figure exists across slave-narratives, but also that they deploy a communal ideology that attempts to conflate unwillingness with inability. They enable the perpetuation of the institution by their unwillingness to reject the economic benefits of slavery, which they conceive of as an inability.
