## Praise for *Interpreting Meat*

> "We are regularly bombarded by texts about the horrors we inflict on animals, texts which emphasize the need for some kind of basic solidarity with animals, since we are all living species on our earth. Teddy Duncan does something long awaited here: he shifts the focus on meat as a commodity, on how our mistreatment of animals is emblematic of today's capitalism. In his approach which unites Marxism and psychoanalysis, all the fetishes and fantasies at work in our treatment of animals are clearly displayed. Nothing will remain the same after Duncan's book – all those who deal with the relationship between humans and animals but ignore capitalist reality will appear as what they are: ignorants who pass in silence over the key dimension of the problem. If Duncan's book will not become a classic, then we perhaps deserve to perish."  
> — **Slavoj Žižek**

> "Bringing Marxist and psychoanalytic insights to bear on the processes of meat production and consumption, Duncan's fascinating analysis uncovers a novel way of thinking about resisting the meat-commodity: not through prohibitive ethical or legal injunctions, but through recognition and transformation of the social relations and desires that ultimately render animals as Others to be commodified and consumed. This work is both an essential contribution and fundamental challenge to existing discussions in animal studies."  
> — **Matthew Calarco**, Professor of Philosophy, California State University, Fullerton

> "Interpreting Meat offers new tools to make sense of the products from capitalist animal agriculture, the consumer desire for these products and the challenge of developing food futures without meat. By encouraging readers to examine meat not through analogy but instead as symptom, Teddy Duncan offers an original and engaging application of the Lacanian psychoanalytic frame."  
> — **Dinesh Wadiwel**, The University of Sydney

> "Interpreting Meat allows fresh insights into one of the most urgently relevant topics of our time. How we treat animal bodies is part of a larger, and profoundly problematic, prioritization of human preferences over animal well-being. We are increasingly confronted with the unsustainability of contemporary modes of interaction with the more-than-human world. A book that facilitates new ways of thinking about meat can help us move beyond entrenched and naturalized understandings of animals. This is such a text, and readers, animals and the planet stand to benefit a great deal from the challenges, tools and questions Duncan offers us."  
> — **Jessica Murray**, Professor, College of Graduate Studies, University of South Africa

> "A timely and thought-provoking addition to contemporary animal studies, offering a multifaceted critique of the processes that commodify animal life and obscure the ethical, ecological, and socio-economic consequences of meat consumption. Duncan challenges readers not only to reconsider the systems that maintain this commodification but also to confront the deeper psychological and cultural desires driving it."
